(1.)Pizza Sales Analysis Project
This project is focused on analyzing the sales data of a fictional pizza restaurant to derive meaningful business insights. The analysis aims to uncover trends in customer orders, revenue generation, and popular pizza types. By leveraging SQL queries, we can efficiently process and analyze large datasets to support data-driven decision-making.


(2.)Database Schema
The database for this project includes the following tables:

-->pizzas: Contains details about each pizza, such as pizza ID, type ID, size, and price.
-->pizza_types: Stores information about different types of pizzas, including type ID, name, category, and ingredients.
-->orders: Records information about customer orders, including order ID, date, and time.
-->order_details: Contains details about each order, such as order details ID, order ID, pizza ID, and quantity.

(3.)Analysis Goals
The analysis is designed to answer several key business questions, including:

-->The total number of orders placed.
-->Total revenue generated from pizza sales.
-->Identification of the highest-priced pizza.
-->Most common pizza size ordered.
-->Top 5 most ordered pizza types.
-->Total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
-->Distribution of orders by hour of the day.
-->Average number of pizzas ordered per day.
-->Category-wise distribution of pizzas.
-->Cumulative revenue over time.
-->Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue for each category.

(4.)Tools Used
(a.)SQL
Structured Query Language (SQL) is the primary tool used in this project for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis. SQL allows us to write queries that efficiently retrieve and process data from the database, enabling us to answer complex business questions.

(b.)Database Management System
A relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL  is used to store and manage the data. The RDBMS provides a robust and scalable environment for handling the pizza sales data.
